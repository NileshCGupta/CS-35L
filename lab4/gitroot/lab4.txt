The patch asked for other files to patch but I skipped passed all prompts

I then go through all the non .c files and revert the changes in emacs using
C-x v = 
C-x v u

I then go through the .c files to change everything except character string constants

We then look in the src/*.c.rej files and copy paste all the changes into the respective files.

When we run git status, we see half a dozen modified files and some untracked files. To remove these, we use 'git clean -f'.

Next, we put git diff into a file using
      git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

To build the modified diffutils, we use
   ./bootstrap
   ./configure	
   make
   make check

We verify that diffutils uses the right apostrophe character using 'diff . -'

When we compare our quote-3.0-pach.txt and quote-3.0-test.txt, we see the files are not identical and the differences are not innocuous since we only kept the changes to code when we modified the .c files.
