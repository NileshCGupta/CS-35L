First, I created a new branch called quote
       git checkout v3.0 -b quote

I then applied the patch I got from lab
       patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

I ran into some problems here since the repository was already patched from the lab so I redownloaded diffutils and it worked. I get the output
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

Next I created a ChangeLog in my diffutils directory and added all six modified files with a brief description of what changed.

Then I commit the changes
      git add .
      git commit -F ChangeLog
The above command configures my name and email as the committer

Then I output the formatted patch into a file using
      git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

Since I do not have a partner, I just created a new branch to test the patch
      git checkout v3.0 -b allalone
      git am < formatted-patch.txt

Next, we build the system
      ./bootstrap
      ./configure
      make
      make check

I initially had a problem with ./bootstrap but I followed the advice on piazza and made changes to the .login, .bashrc, and .bash_profile files. This resolved the PATH issue.

Now, I check if my ChangeLog works using
     make distdir
     cd diffutils*

I look at the ChangeLog file for this and indeed see the original message I entered for the ChangeLog when I created formatted-patch.txt

Last, I downloaded X11 for OS X and used the ssh -X command to access the server. I then cd into ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and ran gitk.
