tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' 
This commmand replaces any instance of a character not included by 'A-Za-z' with a line break.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
This does the same thing as the first command but eliminates all line break between words.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
This command takes the bare list of words given by the second command and sortsthem alphabetically.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
Takes the alphabetical list of words and removes duplicates.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
Gets the alphabetical list of words in  the assignment page and compares each to the words file. This outputs three columns: words unique to the assignment page, words unique to words, and words shared by both.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
Same as the last command but only displays the words uniqure to the assignment file. This list consists of all mispelled words or words that are not in the words file (our dictionary). This command acts as a rudimentary spellchecker. 

Then, I wrote the buildwords shell script using the grep, sed, sort and tr commands. This returns an alphabetical list of Hawaiian words used to spell check. 

Using this, I find how many unique words or mispelled Hawaiian words are in the lab file using the following command
comm labwords Hwords -23 | wc

This outputs
406     405    2602
which means I have 405 unique or mispelled Hawaiian words.

When I run the labwords file against my English spell check I get
39      38     247
which means I have 38 mispelled English words.

Next, I find the number of mispelled Hawaiian words that are actually English using the command
comm labwords Hwords -23 | comm -12 - words | wc

This outputs
370     370    2370
which means that 370 of the 405 mispelled Hawaiian words are actually English. These are words like worry, position, save, that do not use Hawaiian characters

To find the number of mispelled English words that are Hawaiian, I do the same command but switch the files

This outputs
3       3      15
which means that 3 of the 38 mispelled English words are Hawaiian. These words are halau, lau, and wiki.
