I first check if I have all the necessary programs to do the lab using
> dpkg â€“get-selections | grep openssh

It outputs:
openssh-server install
openssh-client install

which means I can proceed.

Server:
I start by generating the public and private keys with
> ssh-keygen

and RETURN three times to use the default location.

This gives me the key fingerprint and the key randomart image.

I then create an account for the client (Perla Bravo) with Username - Username and Password - Password
> sudo useradd -d /home/Perla -m Username
> sudo passwd Password

To make an .ssh directory for the new user, I use
> cd /home/Perla
> sudo mkdir .ssh

Next I change ownwership and permission of the .ssh directory using
> sudo chown -R Username .ssh
> sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Perla then follows the client instructions on his computer and is able to use my computer as a remote host.

Client:
I generate public and private keys using
> ssh-keygen

I need to copy my public key to the server so it can authenticate my host
> ssh-copy-id -i Username@10.97.85.170

Then I add the private key to the ssh-agent
> ssh-add

Next I ssh to my "teammate's" server
> ssh Username@10.97.85.170

This ssh is successful so I exit and use
> ssh -X Username@10.97.85.170
to enable X11 session forwarding

I then run the following commands on the remote host
xterm
gedit
firefox

These all work which mean I successfully connected to the remote server.
